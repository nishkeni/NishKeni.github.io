I am an Electronics, Electrical and Computer Engineer by Formal Education, and a budding [STEM-Logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) by passion. I am currently working with [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) as a Data Scientist in the [Advertising Measurement and Optimization](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/search?offset=0&result_limit=10&sort=relevant&category=data-science&cities[]=Seattle%2C%20Washington%2C%20USA&business_category[]=advertising&distanceType=Mi&radius=24km&latitude=&longitude=&loc_group_id=&loc_query=&base_query=measurement&city=&country=&region=&county=&query_options=&) team, and pursuing Professional Certifications in Artifical Intelligence (focussing on Natural Language Processing & Understanding, Reinforcement Learning and Applied Machine Learning) and Medical Statistics from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu) with a focus in. I recently completed my [M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://github.com/nishkeni/nishkeni.github.io/blob/master/images/MS_ECE_DegreeCertificate_NishantKeni.pdf) at [Georgia Tech, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/) with specialization in Digital Signal Processing, where I was fortunate to work with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari) and [Justin Romberg](https://jrom.ece.gatech.edu). Before that, I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering (Institute Gold Medal) from [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), where I was involved in research with Rizwan Ahmed and [Faruk Kazi](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/resume/kazi_sir.pdf). I am, however, still passively affiliated to the [Center of Excellence (CoE) in Complex and Non-Linear Dynamical Systems (CNDS)](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/index.html), VJTI.

Research Interests
======

My research interests lie in Statistical Learning, Optimization, Causal Inference & Network Science; and I love to think about the Design & Analysis of Algorithms, and Chaos Theory.  My prime hobby is ‘Thinking’ and I like to model real-life scenarios to find their solutions through Mathematics (for e.g. The Linear Inverse Problem Theory relates to how Humans perceive each other). I also like to think about the fusion of Machine Learning and Game Theory, as both these model the most supreme agents we live with; the former created by Humans while the later created by Biological Science!

Get in Touch
======

As a background context, I am <i>aggressively</i> protective of my time, as I believe we all should be. I love to wear the hats of both a researcher and a maker. [Here's](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) an interesting perspective on why disruptions are so corrosive to a maker's schedule. 

If there's anything you believe I can assist you with, I am looking forward to talking to you! If you want to chat with me, please consider e-mailing me first for context, and then using [this](https://calendly.com/nishant-keni) to find a time that works best for you.
